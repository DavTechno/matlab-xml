xmlparse for MATLAB
===================

This is a ridiculously simple and inefficient XML parser for MATLAB. I had the
need to read in a particular xml file one day and noticed that it had a nice 
trait: the parse tree can be represented by a MATLAB struct, where each node
can be represented by a field and its content by either subfields (if the 
content is a node) or by a value of the content is data.

This file, xmlparse, does exactly that.
